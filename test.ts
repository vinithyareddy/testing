Subject: Status Update – SWFP Widgets, Budget Glance Filter, and Test Parallelization (Aug 29)

Hi <Lead Name>,

Here’s my current status—heads-down across three streams:

1) SWFP Widgets

Progress: Created the swfp-by-age-band component skeleton, responsive layout, and data-binding hooks; base styles and accessibility attributes in place.

Next: Wire to service/API, finalize empty/error states, and add unit tests for rendering and sorting.

Risks/Needs: Confirm final API shape and any design tweaks for column widths/labels.

2) Budget Glance – Filter Issue

Progress: Reproduced the alignment bug tied to nested scroll/overflow; refactored to a single scroll container with sticky header to keep borders/columns aligned. Added guard for filter state persistence and basic unit tests.

Next: Cross-browser/viewport QA, verify interaction with combined filters, and add one e2e path for regression.

Risks/Needs: None blocking; a quick UX sign-off on header behavior would help.

3) Test Cases – Parallelism

Progress: Benchmarked current suite, enabled parallel workers in CI, and began grouping tests by tags to balance runtime. Early runs show a clear reduction in total time.

Next: Stabilize a couple of flaky specs, cache dependencies in the pipeline, and document local parallel run steps for the team.

Risks/Needs: May need brief code-owner reviews as we split larger suites.

Given the workload, I’m prioritizing the widget and filter fix first, then wrapping the parallelization work. If you prefer a different order, I can switch.
