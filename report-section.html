    <h2>What is the Prompt-a-thon?</h2>

    <p>
      The Prompt-a-thon is an interactive learning experience designed to help you master querying
      Scorecard data using natural language. You'll work with AI-powered tools to transform how you
      access, understand, and leverage Scorecard insights for your role.
    </p>

    <p>
      This hands-on workshop combines guided tutorials, pre-built prompt templates, and real-time
      feedback so you can ask better questions, interpret results confidently, and trace exactly how
      each answer was produced.

    <h2>How it works</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Tell us about your role and choose your segment to personalize prompts and guidance</li>
      <li>Open the Prompt Library (left sidebar) and drag-and-drop prompts into the chat</li>
      <li>Ask questions and iterate with follow-up prompts ("compare", "drill down", "explain why")</li>
      <li>Review "How computed" to validate filters, SQL, and data sources</li>
      <li>Save/share outputs and tag feedback to improve the experience</li>
    </ol>

  <!-- Warning -->
  <div class="warning-box">
    <h3>Important: Data scope & filters</h3>

    <p>
      This prototype may be limited to a vetted FY25 snapshot. Also, filters can auto-apply (e.g.,
      region/sector/disaggregation). If you get empty results, clear filters or broaden them before re-asking.
